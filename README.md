# Titanic Decision Tree Analysis

Welcome to the Titanic Decision Tree Analysis project! This repository contains an exploration and analysis of the Titanic passenger dataset using decision trees, aiming to predict passenger survival based on various attributes.

## Overview

The sinking of the RMS Titanic on April 15, 1912, resulted in the loss of over 1500 lives, making it one of the deadliest maritime disasters in modern history. This project focuses specifically on analyzing the Titanic dataset using decision tree models to predict passenger survival.

## Contents

- **Notebooks**: This directory contains Jupyter Notebooks used for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and decision tree model development.

- **Data**: This directory contains the Titanic dataset in CSV format.

- **Images**: This directory contains images and plots generated during the analysis and visualization process.

## Analysis Highlights

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the demographics and characteristics of Titanic passengers.
  
- Visualization of survival rates based on passenger attributes such as gender, age, and class.

- Development and evaluation of decision tree models to predict passenger survival.

## Usage
